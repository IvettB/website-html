        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Ivett and I'm 26 years old. I'm studying Computer
          Science and this is my third semester at BYU. Before BYU, I
          went to BYU-Idaho, but I'm thankful for the opportunity to be 
          here now. I am from Hungary and I moved to the U.S. almost five 
          years ago. For the first 2,5 years, I lived in Seattle with a host
          family and helped take care of their children. I just recently got
          engaged, so this is a very exciting time in my life. My fianc√©, Matt,
          and I are planning to get married in the Idaho Falls Temple at the end 
          of April.
        </p>

          I'm very busy with school, so I don't have many hobbies. However, I do
          enjoy running, rock climbing, and horse riding in my free time. In fact,
          when I lived back in Hungary, I had two show horses who regularly won jumping
          and agility competitions. I hope to have more horses in the future, but right
          now I'm focused on my degree.
